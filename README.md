👋 Hi, I’m @BinaryBert. In my previous life, I was a Business Analyst and Computer Science Teacher, but now I'm thriving as a DevOps Engineer!

👀 I’m fascinated by all things DevOps and have a deep-rooted love for open source software. Linux is my second language, and I'm all about its philosophy of freedom, collaboration, and transparency. From cloud infrastructures to CI/CD pipelines, my passion lies in experimenting, pushing boundaries, and transforming 'what if' into 'what is'.

🌱 I’m currently delving deeper into the universe of container orchestration and attempting to tame the beast known as Kubernetes. I'm also dipping my toes in the world of artificial intelligence, specifically experimenting with Langchain and the OpenAI API. The fusion of AI and programming excites me, and I am on a journey to discover its untapped potential.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects that challenge the norm and push the boundaries of conventional programming. Whether it's crafting innovative scripts, simplifying complex systems, enhancing the Linux community, or pioneering AI-based solutions, if it involves breaking and building things better, I'm in!

📫 You can always drop a comment or a pull request on one of my repos.

Remember, in the world of binary, I'm Bert.
